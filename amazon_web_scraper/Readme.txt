While this web scraper worked initially, Amazon has recently 
blocked automated / multiple page requests and has integrated captchas that are 
currently unable to be bypassed easily by myself. I have yet
to find anyone with a workaround as well. I did change to Amazon.co.uk
which worked temporarily, but that site also got the automated
scraping prevention measures implemented as well.

I have begun to work on an Etsy scraper and am in the process of overcoming
obstacles to make that one work.
